1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase? 
Increasing the number of hidden nodes initially increases the accuracy of the model. However, after a certain point, 
increasing the number of hidden nodes can lead to overfitting, which can decrease the accuracy on the test set. In this
case, the accuracy peaks at around 5 hidden units and then starts to decrease as the number of hidden units is increased further.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
It has the lowest accuracy for 1 hidden unit and maximum accuracy for 5 hidden units. Between 1 hidden unit to 50 hidden units,
the accuracy of the model fluctuates from 67.5% to 91.25%
